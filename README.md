# Interview Task

This repo contains a possible solution for an interview task. The application aims to make it easy to search movies by title through the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started). I have used the following libraries to create the application:

- Front-end application:
   - React
   - TypeScript
   - Styled components
- Back-end application: 
   - NodeJs
   - ExpressJs
   - TypeScript

# Live Demo

You can test the application here: http://biroda.gaborhegoczki.com

# How to Run It?

1. Clone the repository from github
2. Start the server:
   - Navigate to the `api` folder. 
   - Run `yarn` command to download all dependencies.
   - Run `yarn dev` to run the back-end server on your machine. Server will run on port `5000` by default.
3. Start the front-end application:
   - Navigate to the `app` folder.
   - Run `yarn` command to download all dependencies.
   - Run `yarn start` to run the front-end application in your browser.
4. Now you should be able to use the application :rocket:
