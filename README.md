# Interview Task

This repo contains a possible solution for an interview task. I used the following technologies to create this application:

- React
- TypeScript
- Styled Components
- NodeJs
- ExpressJs
- Yarn

# Live Demo

You can test the application here: http://biroda.gaborhegoczki.com

# How to Run It?

1. Clone the repository from github
2. Run the back-end application first. Go to the `api` folder and run the following command:
   `yarn`.
   After all packages are download, you can run the development server with the following command: `yarn dev`
3. Go to the `app` folder and initialize the application with the usual `yarn` command. After all packages are download, you can run the front-end application with the following command:
   `yarn start`.
4. Now you have both the back-end and front-end applications running. :rocket:
